If the element was successfully replaced then true is returned, if the old object did not exist then false is returned and the toAdd object is added to the BST.  Remember that you cannot just replace an element by changing its value because it may not belong at that spot in the tree after being replaced.  

	public boolean delete(Comparable old);
